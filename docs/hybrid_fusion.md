# Hybrid fusion: RRF, DBSF, weighted RRF

## When to use
- You do not know in advance whether queries will be keyword-like or paraphrased, and want one method that is never the worst.

## When not to
- One leg is clearly stronger on your data. On TVPL, dense alone beats every hybrid here: fusing in a weaker BM25 leg pulls good dense results down.

## How it works
- [`fusion.py`](../src/retrieval_playbook/fusion.py): each leg is a Qdrant prefetch (`limit = k * 4`) and the outer query fuses them inside Qdrant, so there is one round trip.
  - `hybrid_rrf`: reciprocal rank fusion, uses ranks only.
  - `hybrid_dbsf`: distribution-based score fusion, normalises each leg's scores before adding them.
  - `hybrid_weighted_rrf`: RRF with weights per leg, dense 1.0 and sparse 0.5 (Qdrant 1.17+).
- Several subqueries are merged by taking each chunk's best score ([multi-query](multi_query.md)).

- Weighted RRF is the best hybrid on both sets and the best method overall on SciFact.
- Plain RRF treats the two legs as equals; when the sparse leg is clearly weaker (TVPL) it costs 0.03 nDCG@10 against dense alone.
- The weights were set once (dense 1.0, sparse 0.5) and not tuned on these test sets.

## Lessons from production
- Measured on internal data, data not published. The same audit found that scores from three sources sat on incompatible scales, and that chunks of one document collapsed into the worst-ranked one.
- Measured on internal data, data not published. Hybrid beat dense alone by a little: recall@10 0.416 vs 0.403, keyword alone 0.301.
